#HOW TO NAVIGATE THE PAGE
You load up the page  and a rustic garden image loads up.  on the upper corner there's a login link  that routes you to another page were  can log in and then it routes you back to the root of the page or you can click on my garden and it loads you your profile that includes all the gardens you have 
Each garden has a theme aka the type of garden and a  location
In my gardens
There are links t to either create a new garden or go back to the root. 


Each garden has a link at the top of its box where you can enter the garden 
within each garden you can search for a vegetable and add it into your garden. 
 You can also delete each vegetable that lies within your garden .

Outside of the Auth Boiler Plate ,through this project , I looked at No outside sources .


#PROBLEMS I FACED 
I had a a tough time understanding how everything was connected in the back end . 


unlike project one where you only had to worry about JavaScript CSS and HTML intuitively its simple understand how they're connected.
I struggled to understand not just writing the crud routes and  then working on the ejs pages .
I went in to project to with quite a lot of hopes and dreams as to what I could have accomplished within this week ,I wanted to implement the edamame api which would recommend recipes for you based on the vegetables that are within your garden . 
       In the end I don't think I planned well enough at the beginning and understood the database model cumulatively  all these problems slowed my progress to a crawl and I didn't accomplish as much as I wished I did in the week.
   This is definitely a project that needs to be worked on . It may be MVP but it left me dissatisfied presenting such an unpolished product , also a bit frustrated with myself and a little l actually did. 


#WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO GET BETTER AT  
literally everything I would love to get better and everything  , I have a tendency of jumping ahead of myself in reading about machine learning ,deep learning, kubernetes and knative that works on top of kubernetes. I would love nothing more but to get to a point where I'm at the Edge of understanding, the tip of the sphere when it comes to tech  hopefully I can get to that point.  till then I need a work on deepening my understanding of everything.
